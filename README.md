In the above directory structure, you have separate directories for AWS and Azure configurations, along with a modules directory for any shared modules that can be used across both providers. The variables.tf file defines common variables used in both AWS and Azure configurations, and the terraform.tfvars file contains variable values specific to your project.

Each provider directory (e.g., aws and azure) should have its own main Terraform configuration file (main.tf) and any other necessary files for resources specific to that cloud provider.

For example, the aws/main.tf file may include AWS-specific resources like AWS EC2 instances, security groups, etc., while the azure/main.tf file may include Azure-specific resources like Azure Virtual Machines, network security groups, etc.

You can use the shared modules placed in the modules directory to avoid duplication and promote reusability across your configurations.

To apply changes to a specific cloud provider, navigate to the respective directory (e.g., cd aws or cd azure) and run terraform init, terraform plan, and terraform apply commands as usual.

By organizing your Terraform project in this manner, you can maintain separate configurations for different cloud providers and keep the codebase clean and modular.
